An earthquake does not exhibit any particular pattern, it is presumed as a spontaneous phenomenon that can damage huge number of lives and properties, and currently there is no any model exists that can accurately predict the exact position, magnitude, frequency and time of an earthquake.

The ability of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based techniques to uncover buried patterns in data is well established. These models also result in an encouraging result when used to predict earthquakes.

A machine learning model capable of predicting earthquakes must be able to predict the accurate location, magnitude spectrum and precise occurrence time and chances of occurrence so that it allows authorities to deploy resources, and shutdown devices which will cause major damage.

So the prediction of earthquakes are highly beneficial and giving prior notifications to the people.
